#### Software

- [`asreview`](https://pypi.org/project/asreview/) in Python: Active learning for systematic reviews (core development team member)

    > Systematic Reviews are “top of the bill” in research. The number of scientific studies is increasing exponentially in many scholarly fields. Performing a sound systematic review is a time-consuming and sometimes boring task. Our software is designed to accelerate the step of screening abstracts and titles with a minimum of papers to be read by a human with no or very few false negatives.
