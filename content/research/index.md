#### Optimal Stratification in Bayesian Adaptive Survey Designs
_Statistics Netherlands_

- Collecting official statistics survey data is getting more difficult. Costs have been increasing while budgets have been decreasing. The deteriorating response rates also yield nonresponse bias that jeopardizes the validity of inferences from data. Adaptive survey designs are based on the rationale that any population is heterogeneous in both: its response and answers to surveys and its costs to be recruited and interviewed. Different data collection strategies may be effective for different members of the population.

- This project aims to reduce nonresponse bias by effectively and efficiently stratifying the target population into subgroups that can be approached by different data collection strategies.

- As an intern, I am writing my master's thesis within this project under the supervision of Dr. Nino Mushkudiani and Prof. Dr. Barry Schouten.

#### ASReview: Active Learning for Systematic Reviews
_Utrecht University_

> Systematic Reviews are “top of the bill” in research. The number of scientific studies is increasing exponentially in many scholarly fields. Performing a sound systematic review is a time-consuming and sometimes boring task. Our software is designed to accelerate the step of screening abstracts and titles with a minimum of papers to be read by a human with no or very few false negatives.

- PI: Prof. Dr. Rens van de Schoot

- As a core team member, my task involves:
    1. Preprocess the metadata of training data sets from published systematic reviews
    2. Back-end Python API, and front-end JavaScript user interface development
