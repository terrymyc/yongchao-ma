Collecting official statistics survey data is getting more difficult.
Costs have been increasing while budgets have been decreasing. Declining response rates yield nonresponse bias that jeopardizes the validity of inferences from data. As a result, statistical institutes are interested in adaptive survey designs that can balance cost and data quality. Analogous to the group sequential designs in clinical trials, adaptive survey designs are based on the rationale that different data collection strategies may be effective for different members of the population.

As an intern, I am writing my master's thesis within this project under the supervision of Dr. Nino Mushkudiani and Prof. Dr. Barry Schouten.

This paper will be presented at the New Developments in Adaptive Survey Design session of the European Survey Research Association 2021 [online conference](https://www.europeansurveyresearch.org/conferences/glanceProgram2021?sess=10#57) on July 2, 2021.

**Abstract:**
In an increasing number of survey designs, adaptive data collection strategies for different members of the population are adopted to balance the data quality and cost.
Stratifying the target population into subgroups in an effective manner plays a decisive role in identifying the optimal adaptive survey design.
This paper presents a stratification method on the basis of which the optimal adaptive survey designs can be constructed under the Bayesian analysis to minimize nonresponse bias.
The utility of this method compared to two other response- and cost-oriented stratification methods is assessed through a case study based on the Dutch Health Survey.
The optimal adaptive survey designs based on the proposed method outperform in minimizing nonresponse bias, which indicates that the underlying stratification is the optimal stratification.
