Systematic reviews are “top of the bill” in research. The Active learning for Systematic Reviews (ASReview) project, publised in [Nature Machine Intelligence](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-020-00287-7), implements machine learning algorithms to accelerate the step of screening abstracts and titles with a minimum of papers to be read by a human with no or very few false negatives.

As a research assistant under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Rens van de Schoot, my task involves:
1. Preprocess the metadata of training data sets from published systematic reviews
2. Back-end Python API, and front-end JavaScript user interface development
