I am a research master student and research assistant in the Department of Methodology and Statistics at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en). I am also an intern at [Statistics Netherlands](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb).

I received a Bachelor's degree in Sociology from China in 2017 and a Master's degree in Criminology and Criminal Justice from the University of Macau in 2019, including a one-semester exchange program at Link√∂ping University in Sweden.

My research interests focus on survey nonresponse, Bayesian adaptive survey designs, and programming.
